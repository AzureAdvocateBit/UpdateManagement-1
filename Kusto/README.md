<b><u>Update Agent Readiness - Explained</b></u>
<br>In the portal, the Update Agent Readiness column data is lazy-loaded. Azure checks readiness of every machine individually using this following <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/automation/hybridrunbookworkergroup/get">REST API</a>. 
<br><br><b>Update Agent Readiness - GET Calls</b>
<br>The update readiness metric solely checks if the patch agent (System HybridWorker) is registered and actively pinging. Each response code (Ready, Disconnected, Not configured) denotes a specific readiness state within the column.
<br>1) <i>Not Configured</i> - the GET call resolves to 404.
<br>2) <i>Disconnected</i> - The GET call resolves to 200, but the lastSeen property value (related to ping time) is older than an hour ago.
<br>3) <i>Ready</i> - The GET call resolves to 200 and the lastSeen property is less than an hour ago.
If the GET call resolves to 200, but lastSeen property value (denotes the ping time) is older than an hour ago â€“ we call it

<br>1) CVE Numbers are only listed for Linux within the underlying database engine for Kusto, except not every Linux server contains a CVE Number.
<br>2) TimeGenerated refers to when the scheduled job started. There is currently no way to capture the time a patch applied.
